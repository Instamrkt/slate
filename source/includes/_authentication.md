# Authentication

Instamrkt uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Instamrkt API key at our [developer portal](http://instamrkt.com/).

Instamrkt expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`header: YOUR_INSTAMRKT_API_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `YOUR_INSTAMRKT_API_KEY` with your personal API key.
</aside>

<aside class="success">
Remember â€” we care about security for your own good!
</aside>

<aside class="warning">If you're not using an administrator API key, note that some kittens will return 403 Forbidden if they are hidden for admins only.</aside>
